Create a responsive web portfolio using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla) and Tailwind CSS for styling. Optionally, use Node.js for backend functionality (like sending messages via contact form).

The portfolio should include the following sections and functionality:


---

📄 1. Hero Section / Introduction

A bold header with the developer's name and title ("Web Developer" or similar).

A short introductory tagline.

A "Download CV" button that allows users to download a static PDF (e.g., cv.pdf).


🧑‍💼 2. About Me Section

Short paragraph(s) about the developer.

A profile image (optional).

Include a few highlighted soft and technical skills (could be shown as icons or bullet points).


💼 3. Skills Section

Showcase skills using icons or progress bars (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, Node.js, etc.).


🧰 4. Projects Section

Display 3–4 recent projects.

Each project should have a title, screenshot, short description, and live/demo link + GitHub link.


🗣 5. Testimonials Section

Include 2–3 testimonials from clients or peers.

Each testimonial should have the name, avatar (optional), and short feedback.


📞 6. Contact Section

A "Get In Touch" form with fields: Name, Email, Message.

On submitting, a popup message (JavaScript alert or custom modal) should confirm:
“Your message has been sent successfully!”

You may use Node.js backend with Nodemailer or a simple placeholder action.

Multiple "Contact Me" buttons should be scattered across the site, especially in the Hero and Footer.


📫 7. Contact Info Section

Display phone number, email, and optionally a location or LinkedIn/GitHub links.


🔝 8. Sticky Navigation Bar

Links to all sections: About, Skills, Projects, Testimonials, Contact.

Smooth scroll behavior on link click.


⚙ 9. General Requirements

Must be responsive (works well on mobile/tablet).

Tailwind CSS should be used for all layout/styling.

Use vanilla JavaScript (no React).

Add subtle hover effects, smooth scrolling, and animation where appropriate.

Code should be structured and well-commented.


Optional:

Host CV and images in a public or assets folder.

Basic form validation (e.g., all fields are required).

Dark mode toggle (if not too complex).



---

Output everything in a single downloadable folder structure with:

/index.html

/styles/ for Tailwind or custom CSS

/scripts/ for JavaScript

/assets/ for images and CV

/server/ (optional Node.js backend files)
